# Changelog

## 9.2.0 (2023-12-4)

* **feat** added export for `markNTBT` function.

## 9.1.0 (2023-11-30)

A long time coming, but we are back :)
We did some internal cleanup, making the library more accessible for tracking Critical User Journeys.

The most significant change is that we moved away from being Object-oriented and everything is Functional-oriented, which means to start Perfume, you can do.

```javascript
import { initPerfume } from 'perfume.js';

initPerfume({
  analyticsTracker: ({ metricName, data }) => {
    myAnalyticsTool.track(metricName, data);
  })
});
```

### Breaking Changes
* **feat** remove `enableNavigationTracking` and have the behavior as the default.
* **feat** `getRating` has been consolidated into `getVitalsScore`.
* **chore** rename `incrementUjNavigation` to `trackUJNavigation`.
* **chore** deprecate `endPaint`.

## 8.4.0 (2023-2-3)

* **fix:** disable `requestIdleCallback` for CLS and INP reports (#212)

## 8.3.0 (2023-1-29)

* **feat:** added `navigationType` support (#210)
* **fix:** run `po` for longtask only once (#215)

## 8.2.0 (2022-12-30)

* **feat:** added ability to provide web-vitals report options

## 8.1.6 (2022-12-30)

* **fix:** added back the `visibility.isHidden` check when reporting metrics. Apparently, without this check, we end up over-reporting metrics that risk being inaccurate because the page suddenly becomes hidden.

Currently, the only initial metrics that will be reported after visibility changes are CLS and INP.

## 8.0.0 (2022-11-6)

* **feat:** made Perfume.js a superset of the [Web Vitals](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals) library. This means you will get access to all the latest metrics from Google and plus all the extra features you learn to love from Perfume.
* **feat:** with Web Vitals now we get for free also the INP metric.

### Breaking Changes
As now we are a superset of Web Vitals, here a quick overview on what changed:
- Metrics like TTFB, CLS might have a slight change in value as the Web Vitals lib covers more edge cases.
- The CLS metric will fire when the page changes visibility and not anymore after FID.
- The `analyticsTracker` options will use the word `attribution` for all custom data of each metric, and `vitalsScore` will change to `rating`.
```ts
new Perfume({
    ...
    analyticsTracker: ({ attribution, metricName, data, navigatorInformation, rating }) => {
        // Report the metric with your favorite analytics tool
    }
});
```
- The name for all Vital metric will be in uppercase, such as `FID`, `LPC`, etc...

## 7.1.0 (2022-5-25)

* **feat:** added `redirectTime` as new Core Vitals metric (`rt`).

## 7.0.0 (2022-2-21)

* **feat:** changed both TBT and NTBT Vitals to be less than 200 milliseconds for Good Score.

## 6.4.0 (2022-2-21)

* **feat:** added `perfume.markNTBT` as a way to mark the new Navigation Total Blocking Time metric.

## 6.3.0 (2021-10-20)

* **feat:** added `redirectTime` to `navigationTiming`, this will help better understand performance regression related to redirect requests.

## 6.2.0 (2021-5-5)

* **fix:** terser properties updated.

## 6.1.0 (2021-5-5)

* **feat:** improved CLS and all metrics accuracy to four digits after the decimal point.

## 6.0.0 (2021-5-5)

* **feat:** introduced **Time to First Byte** as his own top-level metric.
* **feat:** simplified **Total Blocking Time** metrics into one solo version that focuses on waiting 10s after **First Input Delay**.
* **feat:** increased the `maxMeasureTime` default value from 15s to 30s, this will allow better data for metrics like LCP which tend to have much higher values. 

### Breaking Changes
The two key breaking changes in v6 are focus around the simplification of First Input Delay and Total Blocking Time, and the increase of the default value for `maxMeasureTime`.

## 5.3.0 (2020-9-2)

* **feat:** added the raw `performanceEntry` object in the reporting for FID and FID Vitals. This will help developer to do more custom analysis based on the FID target.

## 5.2.3 (2020-8-28)

* **fix:** miss PerformanceObserver in rollup config

## 5.2.2 (2020-8-27)

* **fix:** added processingStart in minified file

## 5.2.1 (2020-8-27)

## 5.2.0 (2020-8-26)

* **fix:** conditionally make calls to PerformanceObserver.takeRecords which does not exist in Safari [#138](https://github.com/Zizzamia/perfume.js/pull/138)
* **fix:** report CLS when value is 0
* **feat:** prepare new FID iteration for v6
* **chore:** Italian README [#137](https://github.com/Zizzamia/perfume.js/pull/137)

## 5.1.1 (2020-8-12)

* **fix:** added storage.estimate feature detection [#136](https://github.com/Zizzamia/perfume.js/issues/136)

## 5.1.0 (2020-6-2)

* **feat:** added web vitals score to metrics [#126](https://github.com/Zizzamia/perfume.js/issues/126)
* **feat:** added element timing support [#124](https://github.com/Zizzamia/perfume.js/pull/124)

## 5.0.2 (2020-5-9)

* **fix:** measuring with `perfume.end()` now returns the **duration** of the annotation instead of an object

## 5.0.0 (2020-5-9)

* **feat:** simplified the `analyticsTracker` by having all duration value inside the `data` property
* **feat:** enabled `PerformanceObserver` for all browser, before was only for Chrome
* **feat:** added Total Blocking Time [#112](https://github.com/Zizzamia/perfume.js/issues/112)
* **feat:** added Total Blocking Time Final for when the page's lifecycle state changes to hidden
* **feat:** added secondary log for LCP and CLS called LCP Final & CLS Final for when the page's lifecycle state changes to hidden
* **feat:** added `storageEstimateQuota` and `storageEstimateUsage` to the **navigatorInfo** results
* **fix:** added feature detection for `clearMarks`
* **fix:** solved issue with `storageEstimate` and created his own event
* **refactor:** reduced library size to 2Kb gzipped

### Breaking Changes

Until now, we allowed only Chrome to run the PerformanceObserver interface because of possible cross-browser issues. One in particular related to Firefox 58: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1403027. Starting from Perfume.js v5, we are going to remove this limitation.

Having both `duration` and 	`data` inside the `analyticsTracker`, it started causing some confusion. Starting from v5, we will keep only `data` and have any information from `duration` contained inside `data`. Please make sure to change the code inside your `analyticsTracker`.

More changes:
- Removed the development logging options, in favor of focusing more on the `analyticsTracker` method.
- Removed warning logs for `start()` and `end()` methods, because the code already handles those edge cases.
- Renamed most of metric names, please read [README Quickstart](https://github.com/Zizzamia/perfume.js#quick-start) to see the latest name version we have. We made most of metric with short names, to allow the library to be even smaller.
- Simplified `EstimateStorage` values, to help reduce library size.
